This subdirectory contains the problems contributed by the University
of California, Berkeley.

Please contact

	Paul Vojta <vojta@math.berkeley.edu>

with any questions, bug reports, etc.

Problem files in this directory are organized as follows.  The top-level
directory reflects the textbook (currently just Stewart's Calculus,
Early Transcendentals).  The next level down is the section number.
Below that, files may have different names as follows:

	a-b-c.pg	Based closely on problem c in Section a.b of Stewart

	a-b-xnn.pg	Belongs in Section a.b of Stewart, but not modeled
			closely on any problem of Stewart.  In this case nn
			is just a sequence number.

	a-b-rescuen.pg	A retained copy of a problem that was deleted from the
			OPL.  Again, n is a sequence number.  The full path
			of the original problem is given in a comment in the
			problem file.

	local-name.pg	A locally modified version of the problem name.pg from
			the OPL.  The full path is given in a comment in the
			problem file.
